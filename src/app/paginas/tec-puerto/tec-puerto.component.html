      <h2>SPACEPORT</h2>
      <p>A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for
        ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take
        advantage of the Earth’s rotation for launch.</p>
