      <h2>SPACE CAPSULE</h2>
      <p>A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's
        atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space
        gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.</p>
